# TODO: How do I figure out what's the wanted frequency of mutation and
#       diffusion?
# CANC: Where exactly do I "global foo"? In which scopes and namespaces does
#       "foo" lives?

# DONE: BUG: check for sameness shouldn't be on its own loop but just at the
#       top of the algorithm's loop so each check will be followed.immediately
#       by one diffuse call and one mutate call.
# DONE: Getting this into OO
